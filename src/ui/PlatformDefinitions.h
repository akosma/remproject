// When using POCO and JUCE together, Windows requires to use
// a different set of header files for JUCE than in Unixes:
#if defined(_WIN32)
#include <src/juce_WithoutMacros.h>
#else
#include <juce.h>
#endif

// Somehow in Mac OS X, using the native UI controls 
// in "Debug" mode hangs the application... This does not
// happen in "Release", so here we make the compiler 
// choose the right setting for each environment.
// When calling JUCE dialog boxes, use the NATIVE_DIALOG macro
// to specify the type of control to use.
#if defined(__APPLE__) && defined(__MACH__)
#ifdef USE_JUCE_DIALOGS
#define NATIVE_DIALOG false
#else
#define NATIVE_DIALOG true
#endif
#endif
