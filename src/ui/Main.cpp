 *
 * The project aims to the creation of an UML tool suitable both for academia and the industry, 
 * including Ivar Jacobson's proposed extensions for Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD).
 *
 * \li Creation of a cross-platform (Linux, Windows & Mac OS X) UML editor, using C++;
 * \li  Allow users to create (in its first release) use case, sequence and class diagrams;
 * \li  Include AOSD extensions to create models for aspects, pointcuts and advices;
 * \li  Provide interoperability through the export of diagrams using the XMI standard;
 * \li  Deliver a high-quality code base, thoroughly unit- and functionally tested;
 * \li  Provide a usable, standard and easy-to-use user interface.
 *
 * The name "Rem" stands for "Requirements and Entity Modeler" but is also a reference to 
 * Rem Koolhaas, one of the greatest urbanists and architects of all time. 
 * The icon of the application is a stylized representation of one of Koolhaasâ€™ major works, 
 * the building of the Seattle Public Library.
