Rem
===

The project aims to the creation of an UML tool suitable both for
academia and the industry, including Ivar Jacobson's proposed extensions
for Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD).

- Creation of a cross-platform (Linux, Windows & Mac OS X) UML editor,
  using C++;
- Allow users to create (in its first release) use case, sequence and
  class diagrams;
- Include AOSD extensions to create models for aspects, pointcuts and
  advices;
- Provide interoperability through the export of diagrams using the XMI
  standard;
- Deliver a high-quality code base, thoroughly unit- and functionally
  tested;
- Provide a usable, standard and easy-to-use user interface.

The name "Rem" stands for "Requirements and Entity Modeler" but is also
a reference to Rem Koolhaas, one of the greatest urbanists and
architects of all time. The icon of the application is a stylized
representation of one of Koolhaasâ€™ major works, the building of the
Seattle Public Library.
