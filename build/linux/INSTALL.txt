Building Rem in Kubuntu Linux 7.10 "Gutsy Gibbon"
=================================================

Much of the explanations for building JUCE in Kubuntu are taken from this entry in Rem author's blog:
http://kosmaczewski.net/2007/11/16/building-juce-on-kubuntu-710/

1) Lua
------

Make sure that you have the Lua programming language installed (you can use your favorite package manager to install it), or you can grab the source files from 
http://www.lua.org/



2) SQLite 3
-----------

Using Synaptic manager or any other package manager, install the "libsqlite3" library.



3) Libraries required by JUCE
-----------------------------

Make sure that you have the following libraries installed in your Kubuntu installation using Synaptic or any other package manager, as specified in this JUCE forum post:
http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juceforum/viewtopic.php?t=1312&highlight=audio+build

- libx11-dev
- libasound2-dev
- libfreetype6-dev
- libxinerama-dev
- libglu1-mesa-dev
- libglut3-dev (with its dependency freeglut3-dev too)
- libssl-dev



4) Download premake from Sourceforge
------------------------------------

You can download premake http://premake.sourceforge.net/ from this link:
http://prdownloads.sf.net/premake/premake-linux-3.4.tar.gz

Unzip the file and install the binary where you want (typically /usr/bin). You have to do this manually, since premake is not available through the Synaptic package manager, in any repository.



5) Install CMake 2.4
--------------------

Install it using Synaptic or any other package manager.



6) Build JUCE
-------------

- "cd" into the lib/juce/build/linux folder.
- Run "sh runpremake" which will use premake and Lua to create a makefile
- Run "make" (which is equal to "make CONFIG=Debug") or "make CONFIG=Release" to build the library; a couple of minutes later you’ll have a "juce/bin/libjuce_debug.a" and a "juce/bin/libjuce.a" library files ready to use.



7) Build POCO
-------------

- "cd" into the lib/poco folder.
- Type "chmod 755 configure" to make the "configure" script executable.
- Type "chmod 755 build/script/*" to make all build scripts executable.
- Type "configure", "make" and "sudo make install" to build and install the POCO library. This operation might take several minutes.



8) Build Rem
------------

The "build.sh" shell script in this folder shows how to build Rem and the distribution package using CMake. The resulting binaries will be placed in a "bin" subfolder at the root of the current distribution of Rem.
