Building Rem in Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard" (PowerPC or Intel)
==========================================================

These instructions explain how to build Rem from source code in Leopard.

1) Install Xcode
----------------

Install the Xcode developer tools (bundled with Mac OS X). Rem has been successfully built with both Xcode 3.0 (bundled with Leopard) and 3.1 (bundled with the iPhone developer tools).



2) CMake 2.6
------------

- Download CMake 2.6 from http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.6/cmake-2.6.0-Darwin-universal.dmg 
- Open the DMG file, and execute the installer in the disk image.
- When prompted to install the command-line utilities in /usr/bin, answer "YES"



3) CppUnit 1.12.1
-----------------

Install CppUnit in the usual Unix paths, with the following commands:

    $ mkdir ~/Desktop/cppunit/
    $ cd ~/Desktop/cppunit/
    $ curl http://switch.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/cppunit/cppunit-1.12.1.tar.gz > cppunit-1.12.1.tar.gz
    $ tar xvfpz cppunit-1.12.1.tar.gz
    $ cd cppunit-1.12.1

To build Universal Binaries of the CppUnit library, follow these instructions taken from the CppUnit wiki,
http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/BuildingCppUnit1#head-606831052dc6f25163a5f79aec04dcdbd05a7329

When building on an Intel machine:

    $ ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking CXXFLAGS="-arch ppc -arch i386 -gdwarf-2 -O2"
    $ make AM_LDFLAGS="-XCClinker -arch -XCClinker ppc -XCClinker -arch -XCClinker i386"
    $ sudo make install

When building on a PowerPC machine (with Universal SDK installed):

    $ ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking CXXFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk -arch ppc -arch i386 -gdwarf-2 -O2"
    $ make AM_LDFLAGS="-XCClinker -arch -XCClinker ppc -XCClinker -arch -XCClinker i386 -XCClinker -isysroot -XCClinker /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk"
    $ sudo make install

This last step will install the headers in /usr/local/include/cppunit and the libraries in /usr/local/lib.



4) Fix an incompatibility in the 10.4u SDK
------------------------------------------

Type the following command in Terminal.app
    
    $ sudo ln -s /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib/crt1.o /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib/crt1.10.5.o



5) Get a Universal Binary version of POCO 1.3.2
-----------------------------------------------

To download a precompiled version of POCO as Universal Binary, go to this forum post:
http://www.openframeworks.cc/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2371#2371
There is a link to download the lib there:
http://openframeworks.cc/files/poco/poco-universal.zip
Unzip the file and place it in the "lib" subfolder of this project, together with the "juce" folder.



6) Build JUCE 1.45
------------------

Go to lib/juce/build/macosx and open the Juce.xcodeproj file with Xcode. 

    a) In Xcode 2.5 the library compiles out of the box.
    b) In Xcode 3 (Leopard-only):
        b.1) Select the "Juce" target and open the "Info" dialog box, "Build" tab.
        b.2) Remove the dependencies to GCC 3 and to the Mac OS X 10.2 SDK. Instead, specify GCC 4.0.
        b.3) In the "Base SDK Path" entry specify "$(DEVELOPER_SDK_DIR)/MacOSX10.4u.sdk" for Release and Debug
        b.4) In the "Architectures" entry specify "$(NATIVE_ARCH)" for Debug, and "ppc i386" for Release.
    c) Build the solution using the "Build" button in the toolbar, in both Debug and Release modes.



7) Install Doxygen
------------------

Install Doxygen using MacPorts:

    $ sudo port install doxygen



8) Build Rem using Xcode
------------------------

Open build/mac/rem.xcodeproj and click the "Build" button on the toolbar, either in Release or Debug mode. The solution should compile without problems now.



9) Build Rem using CMake
------------------------

The "build.sh" shell script in this folder shows how to use CMake, CPack and CTest to build the application from the command line.



10) Build the documentation with Doxygen
----------------------------------------

Type the following command at the root of the project (where the Doxyfile file resides):

    $ /opt/local/bin/doxygen 



Note about PDF output with Doxygen
----------------------------------

If you want to create a PDF output using Doxygen, you should install first the MacTex distribution, freely available from
http://www.tug.org/mactex/

Download the disk image file from
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/mac/mactex/MacTeX.dmg

Open the image file and execute the installer inside. This will install all the required tools to generate PDF files from the Doxygen documentation.



Note about dynamic libraries and Xcode
--------------------------------------

Xcode has a feature (bug?) when linking executables to static libraries: if both the dynamic and static version of the same library are available (which usually is the case, for example with CppUnit), Xcode will link to the dynamic version, and there is no configuration possible to change this behavior. The only possible solution to get a statically-linked executable is to delete the dynamic library, which forces Xcode to link to the static version. This way, the deployment of the application is easier (even if the resulting binary is obviously larger)
