On the Mac, before building the Rem application using Xcode, do the following:

1) Go to lib/poco and run the following commands:

    chmod 755 configure
    chmod 755 build/script/*
    ./configure
    make

2) Go to lib/juce/build/macosx and open the Juce.xcodeproj file with Xcode. 

    a) In Xcode 2.5 the library compiles out of the box.
    b) In Xcode 3 in Leopard you must remove the dependencies to GCC 3 and to the Mac OS X 10.2 SDK.

3) Install CppUnit in the usual Unix paths:

    # get cppunit
    mkdir ~/Desktop/cppunit/
    cd ~/Desktop/cppunit/
    curl http://switch.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/cppunit/cppunit-1.12.1.tar.gz > cppunit-1.12.1.tar.gz

    tar xvfpz cppunit-1.12.1.tar.gz

    # build cppunit in the mac platform
    cd cppunit-1.12.1
    ./configure
    cd src/cppunit
    make
    sudo make install
    
This last step will install the headers in /usr/local/include/cppunit and the libraries in /usr/local/lib.
